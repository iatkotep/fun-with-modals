# Notes

Built with **Chakra UI**. I think it does a great job of providing css-in-js functionality without all the boilerplate you get from Styled Components.  It gives nice css-in-js functionality without Styled Components boilerplate, and it has a really excellent style system.

I'm using event delegation to handle Modal Behavior.  It felt like the natural way to go, since I was dealing with an abundance of elements triggering a small number of events. It was lighter weight and more extensible than having to bury callbacks into every element that needed to either close or confirm (or both!) the modal.

I added blocking behavior to the Modal spec, which removes the option to eject.  I think it's a natural behavior for a modal, and it was easy to implement.

I adjusted the spec to have buttons hug the bottom of the viewport when modal is full screen at mobile width.

#### Stories
The Stories I have written for this presentation are divided into two categories:
- **Developer**: These Stories were created to display the Modal in all its possible states.  They provide visual testing.
- **Product**: These Stories were created to show how the Modal can be used.  This is a small sampling of the possible use cases.


## Things I would do differently

#### Documentation
I am using Storybook for everything for this presentation.  It's a nice compromise between development, testing, and documentation. Would prefer a fleshed out README.md (rather than a copy of my API notes) and jsDoc comments in the code.

***

#### Jest tests
Omitted for lack of time.  I have a patterned way of streamlining my stories and tests, which I have done here.  I've put myself in a place where Jest tests will be easy to write.

***

#### No Modal analytics support
State changes in the modal prevent button events from firing.  What I have meets requirements of the Spec, but would have preferred to have an additional layer of functionality

***

#### Modal Forms
Another issue with Modal State management.  Including a Modal Body that managed its own state was creating rerender issues.  I didn't have time to dig into what and when to memoize.

***

#### No Scroll Blocking
It feels natural for a modal to block scrolling functionality while open.  I was not comfortable introducing that here. Since each Modal manages its own state, it would be up to each Modal to disable the scrollbar.  That presents a jurisdiction conflict.  I believe that the scrollbar belongs to the App.

***

#### Using css classes to trigger Modal behavior
My event delegate uses css classes to determine if something important has been clicked. This was for convenience. In practice, I don't think css classes are the right tool for this job.

***

#### Method for conditional Cancel rendering
Supplying button text as a mechanism for conditional rendering feels a little unnatural.  In a real-life scenario, I would prefer a more ergonomic interface.

***

#### Messy JSX
My preference is to define props in an object literal, and then spread them into a JSX element.  This results in very terse and digestible view markup, and allows me to lift the props out of the JSX, and rehome them if needed into a props.ts file.  Sometimes I will use html-style attribute props, but I try to be consistent.  How I handle props for any component is unique to that component, and evolves throughout the development process.  The JSX is messy right now, and needs to be tidied up.

***

#### No style handling for "too many buttons"
I wanted a scrolling overflow, with a max-height on the mobile view, but I was encountering styling issues while trying to implement.

***

#### Action Identification slightly clunky
Because I'm using array indeces to denote my action ids, I'm always going to get a 0 id.  This means I can't do a boolean existence check to see if an action has been selected, because 0 is a falsey value.  so I have to go the extra mile and check for "not null" on the action id.  That doesn't make for a 100% intuitive developer experience.  I could solve the problem by changing the "nothing selected" value from null to -1, but that feels hacky.  The absence of a value should not be represented by a value.  It needs to be null

***

#### Hooks are difficult to test
You can't just test what you've made like a component, you have to write a new component to pull the hook in.  Adds overhead.
